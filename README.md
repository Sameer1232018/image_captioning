# Image Captioning with CNN and NLP

## Overview
Project Kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sameer1232018/image-captioning?scriptVersionId=143315563

This project demonstrates an image captioning system that utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for text generation. The system generates descriptive captions for images, providing a richer context to visual content.

## Project Highlights
- Successfully developed an image captioning system using CNNs and NLP.
- Utilized Python as the primary programming language and popular libraries/frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for CNN model development, tokenization, and data generation.
- Employed tokenization to preprocess image descriptions into tokenized representations.
- Utilized a DataGenerator technique to efficiently handle large image datasets and dynamically generate training data, optimizing memory usage during the training process.

## Dataset
The project used the (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aladdinpersson/flickr8kimagescaptions) dataset from Kaggle.
